# FemCare Insights

# Project Overview:
FemCare Insights is a project focused on analyzing women's health data using clustering techniques to provide meaningful insights. It utilizes Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to group individuals based on their health needs and patterns, helping in better understanding different health conditions.

# Features:
Segmentation of health profiles using clustering models
Identification of key health trends and personalized insights
Data-driven approach to analyzing women's health

# Methodology:
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Cleaned and structured dataset
Incorporated relevant women's health attributes

# Feature Selection:
Identified key parameters influencing health segmentation
Clustering Implementation
Used Hierarchical Clustering and GMMs for segmentation
Evaluated clustering performance
Analysis and Interpretation
Studied the characteristics of different clusters
Derived meaningful insights based on segmentation

# Dataset Details
The dataset consists of health attributes relevant to women
Additional attributes such as Menopause, Menstrual Irregularities, PCOS, and Pregnancy Status will be considered for future updates

# Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Jupyter Notebook for implementation

# Project Status
Clustering models implemented and evaluated
Data segmentation provides meaningful insights
Further improvements planned for dataset and model accuracy

# Future Work
Expanding dataset with additional health conditions
Enhancing the accuracy of clustering models
